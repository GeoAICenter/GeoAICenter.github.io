        <p>The Lab for Spatial AI is an interdisciplinary research hub focused on advancing Spatial Artificial Intelligence (Spatial AI) to understand, model, and predict complex real-world phenomena.
            Leveraging breakthroughs in machine learning, computer vision, geospatial data science, and remote sensing, the lab develops intelligent systems that can perceive and reason about the physical world at multiple scales.
            From urban mobility and smart transportation to climate resilience, natural hazard detection, and spatially-aware robotics, our research transforms high-dimensional spatial and temporal datasets into actionable insights.
            Through collaboration with academia, industry, and government, the lab pushes the frontiers of Spatial AI to create innovative solutions for critical societal challenges while training the next generation of leaders in spatially intelligent technologies.
