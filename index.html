        <p>At the GeoAICenter Lab, our mission is to understand and improve our mobile, interconnected world through Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI).
            Led by Professor Huang, our research pioneers new techniques in spatio-temporal data mining, geo-stream processing, and the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to geographic contexts.
            From optimizing urban mobility in smart transportation networks to uncovering patterns in location-based social media, our goal is to build the next generation of intelligent, location-aware systems.
